# Search Functionality Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a search functionality for conversations in your chat application using ShadCN's Command component. The feature includes a search icon in the header that opens a beautiful, keyboard-accessible search dialog.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Search Icon in Header
- Added a search icon button in the header component (`components/Header.vue`)
- Positioned on the left side with proper spacing and styling
- Includes a tooltip showing the keyboard shortcut (⌘K or Ctrl+K)
- Uses consistent styling with the existing theme toggle

### 2. Search Dialog Component
Created a new `SearchDialog.vue` component with the following features:

#### Visual Design
- Uses ShadCN's Command component for a modern, accessible interface
- Clean, intuitive design with proper spacing and typography
- Icons for visual clarity (search icon, message-circle icons)
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

#### Search Functionality
- **Real-time search**: Filters conversations as you type
- **Recent conversations**: Shows last 5 conversations when no search query
- **Search results**: Displays up to 20 matching conversations
- **Case-insensitive search**: Searches through conversation titles
- **Empty state**: Shows helpful message when no results found

#### User Experience
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press Ctrl+K (or ⌘K on Mac) to open search
- **Quick navigation**: Click any conversation to navigate directly to it
- **Auto-close**: Dialog closes automatically when selecting a conversation
- **Search persistence**: Search query clears when dialog closes
- **Loading states**: Handles API loading states gracefully

### 3. Data Integration
- Fetches conversations from the existing `/api/conversations` endpoint
- Uses the same conversation data structure as the rest of the app
- Consistent date formatting with the sidebar
- Proper error handling for failed API requests

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. **`components/Header.vue`**
   - Added search button with icon
   - Added tooltip with keyboard shortcut
   - Integrated SearchDialog component

2. **`components/SearchDialog.vue`** (new)
   - Command dialog with search input
   - Conversation filtering logic
   - Navigation handling
   - Keyboard shortcuts

### Dependencies Added
- Installed ShadCN Command component via CLI
- Uses existing ShadCN components (Button, Tooltip, Icons)
- Leverages existing API endpoints and data structures

### Key Features
- **Performance**: Only fetches conversations when dialog opens
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Consistent**: Matches existing design patterns
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive search with helpful shortcuts

## Usage

### For Users
1. Click the search icon in the header (top-left)
2. Or use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘K` (Mac)
3. Type to search through conversation titles
4. Use arrow keys to navigate results
5. Press Enter or click to select a conversation

### For Developers
The search functionality is modular and can be easily extended:
- Add more search criteria (search message content, dates, etc.)
- Customize the UI appearance
- Add more keyboard shortcuts
- Integrate with other search providers

## Files Changed
- `components/Header.vue` - Added search button and dialog
- `components/SearchDialog.vue` - New search dialog component
- Added Command UI components via ShadCN CLI

The implementation follows Vue 3 Composition API best practices and integrates seamlessly with your existing Nuxt.js application architecture.
